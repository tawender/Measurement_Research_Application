Programming notes for I2C communication between Raspberry Pi(master)
and multiple MSP430s(slaves) for setup and reading measurements

---------------------------------------------------------------
Application responsibilities:

	-Querry I2C bus to find connected fixtures
	-Sends pulse to trigger MSP430 measurements
	-Sends command to read all sensor measurements(4-bytes each)
	-Sends command to set UV LED1 power level (PWM)
	-Sends command to turn UV LED1 on
	-Sends command to turn UV LED1 off 
	-Sends command to set UV LED2 power level (PWM)
	-Sends command to turn UV LED2 on
	-Sends command to turn UV LED2 off 
	
---------------------------------------------------------------	
MSP430 responsibilities:

	-Respond to trigger pulse by firing interrupt, interrupt triggers sensor measurements
	-Respond to read command by setting I2C Tx buffer with 32-bit float values
